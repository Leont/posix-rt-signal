#ABSTRACT: POSIX Real-time signal handling functions

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use POSIX::RT::Signal qw/sigqueue sigwaitinfo/;
 use Signal::Mask;
 
 $Signal::Mask{USR1}++;
 sigqueue($$, 'USR1');
 my $info = sigwaitinfo('USR1');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exposes several advanced features and interfaces of POSIX real-time signals.

=func sigqueue($pid, $sig, $value = 0)

Queue a signal $sig to process C<$pid>, optionally with the additional argument C<$value>. On error an exception is thrown. C<$sig> must be either a signal number(C<14>) or a signal name (C<'ALRM'>). If the signal queue is full, it returns undef and sets C<$!> to EAGAIN.

=func sigwaitinfo($signals, $timeout = undef)

Wait for a signal in C<$signals> to arrive and return information on it. The signal handler (if any) will not be called. Unlike signal handlers it is not affected by signal masks, in fact you are expected to mask signals you're waiting for. C<$signals> must either be a POSIX::SigSet object, a signal number or a signal name. If C<$timeout> is specified, it indicates the maximal time the thread is suspended in fractional seconds; if no signal is received it returns an empty list, or in void context an exception. If C<$timeout> is not defined it may wait indefinitely until a signal arrives. On success it returns a hash with the following entries:

=over 4

=item * signo

The signal number

=item * code

The signal code, a signal-specific code that gives the reason why the signal was generated

=item * errno

If non-zero, an errno value associated with this signal

=item * pid

Sending process ID

=item * uid

Real user ID of sending process

=item * addr

The address of faulting instruction

=item * status

Exit value or signal

=item * band

Band event for SIGPOLL

=item * value

Signal integer value as passed to sigqueue

=item * ptr

The pointer integer as passed to sigqueue

=back

Note that not all of these will have meaningful values for all or even most signals

=func sigtimedwait

This is an alias for sigwaitinfo.

=func sigwait($signals)

Wait for a signal in $signals to arrive and return it. The signal handler (if any) will not be called. Unlike signal handlers it is not affected by signal masks, in fact you are expected to mask signals you're waiting for. C<$signals> must either be a POSIX::SigSet object, a signal number or a signal name.

=func allocate_signal($priority)

Pick a signal from the set of signals available to the user. The signal will not be given to any other caller of this function until it has been deallocated. If supported, these will be real-time signals. By default it will choose the lowest priority signal available, but if C<$priority> is true it will pick the highest priority one. If real-time signals are not supported this will return C<SIGUSR1> and C<SIGUSR2>

=func deallocate_signal($signal)

Deallocate the signal to be reused for C<allocate_signal>.
